### What does this do?

BIPostalDash provides a set of API libraries for user control of the 
BIPostal data. It also provides a demo User Interface.

### What's it need?

This package requires the following packages:

* <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/bipostal">bipostal</a>

    bipostal mail services (may be installed on another machine and 
    connected via the common bipostal_store package.

* <a href="https://github.com/jrconlin/bipostal_store">bipostal_store</a>

    Common storage library for bipostal. (You'll need to configure this.)

### How do I use it?

This package will allow you to create and manage new BIPostal aliases. These
are used by the milter plugins contained in the *bipostal* package. 

Aside from that, it's also a lovely way to make long strings of random crap. 

### I have more questions!
